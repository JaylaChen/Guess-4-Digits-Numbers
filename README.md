# Guess-4-Digits-Numbers

This puzzle includes two parts.	

One is user guess mode, where the player shall try to guess what 4-digits number that PC generates.

The other one is PC guess mode, where the player may come up a  number in his mind and let PC to do the guessing.

I'm just an amateur and beginner for programming.

Any advice or/and comments are highly appriciated.
   
   Cheers
